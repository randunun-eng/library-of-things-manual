# Library of Things (LOT) - Operational Manual

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

### What is the Library of Things (LOT)?
The Library of Things (LOT) is a community-driven shared resource platform where members can borrow, use, test, and learn from high-value tools, kits, and technologies instead of purchasing them individually.

**Core Values:**
*   Trust
*   Responsibility
*   Learning-by-doing
*   Community contribution

*While this is not a rental shop or marketplace, we facilitate a service to enhance client productivity: members can purchase items they have tested in LOT and wish to own for personal use.*

### Global Inspiration
LOT follows global best practices adapted to the Sri Lankan context, inspired by initiatives like:
*   Library of Great Things (USA)
*   Share Shed Mobile (Australia)
*   Library of Things YXE (Canada)

### How it Works

*   Uploading build photos/videos to the portal.
*   Sharing learning outcomes on Facebook.
*   Helping others (virtually or on-site).

**❌ Deduct Points For:**
*   Late returns or damage.
*   Rule violations or unsafe usage.
*   **Hoarding:** continuously booking items to block others.

## 5. Operational Rules
*To maintain a high standard of availability and quality for all, we have established clear guidelines governing the circulation of items and the conduct of our members.*

## 6. Governance, Safety & Legal
*Ensuring the longevity of the library and the safety of its members requires a robust framework for accountability, risk management, and administrative oversight.*

### Security & Insurance
*   **Deposits:** Refundable; based on risk/value (waived for high-trust members).
*   **Damage/Loss:**
    *   Honest reporting is mandatory.
    *   Outcomes: Repair costs, replacement contribution, or access restriction.
    *   Intentional misuse leads to suspension.

### Liability Disclaimer
*   LOT provides access, not ownership.
*   **Risk:** Members use items at their own risk. LOT is not liable for personal injury.

### Governance & Dissolution
*   **Decision Making:** Founders can alter operations at any time; their decision is final.
*   **If LOT Stops:**
    *   Borrowed items returned.
    *   Deposits refunded.
    *   Donated items remain community assets (transferred to non-profits/schools).
    *   Founding Members can only reclaim donations if LOT ceases entirely (accepting current wear).
