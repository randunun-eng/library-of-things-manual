# Library of Things (LOT) - Operational Manual

## 1. What is the Library of Things (LOT)?
The Library of Things (LOT) is a community-driven shared resource platform where members can borrow, use, test, and learn from high-value tools, kits, and technologies instead of purchasing them individually.

**LOT is built on:**
*   Trust
*   Responsibility
*   Learning-by-doing
*   Community contribution

*While this is not a rental shop or marketplace, we facilitate a service to enhance client productivity: members can purchase items they have tested in LOT and wish to own for personal use.*

## 2. How LOT Operates
LOT operates using a membership-based, trust-level system:
*   Members subscribe to LOT.
*   Members borrow items based on their membership level.
*   Responsible usage earns points.
*   Points unlock higher levels.
*   Higher levels give access to more valuable and rare items.
*   **Access Growth:** Access grows with behavior, not just payment. However, members can initially enter a higher category by paying a higher subscription value to fast-track access to high-level inventories. Basic members can level up by earning points.

## 3. Digital Platform & Community
*   **Virtual Platform:** We operate a virtual cloud-based LOT platform for lending, arranging time slots, booking the physical workspace, payments, new registrations, and terminations.
*   **Gamification:** Each member has an avatar with points, similar to a game. Members submit evidence of their work to earn points.
*   **Community:** A private Facebook page is available for discussions.
