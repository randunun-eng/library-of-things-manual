# Library of Things (LOT) - Operational Manual

## 1. What is the Library of Things (LOT)?
The Library of Things (LOT) is a community-driven shared resource platform where members can borrow, use, test, and learn from high-value tools, kits, and technologies instead of purchasing them individually.

LOT operates using a membership-based, trust-level system:
*   Members subscribe to LOT
*   Members borrow items based on their membership level
